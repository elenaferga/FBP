FBP formalism's documentation
===================================

(nombre) is a Python-based project designed for efficient cosmological computations. The project predicts the Void Probability Function (VPF, i.e, the probability that a randomly placed sphere with radius $r$ is empty of objects -- galaxies or dark matter) and the number density of voids larger than r, nvoids(r). Additionally, given nvoids(r), the code is able to constrain the values of sigma8 and gamma using the Maximum Likelihood test.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section to learn how to quickly run the code.
