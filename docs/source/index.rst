FBP formalism's documentation!
===================================

(nombre) is a Python-based project designed for efficient cosmological computations. The project predicts the Void Probability Function (VPF, i.e, the probability that a randomly placed sphere with radius $r$ is empty of objects -- galaxies or dark matter) and the number density of voids larger than $r$, $\bar{n}_{v}(r)$. Additionally, given $\bar{n}_{v}(r)$, the code is able to constrain the values of sigma8 and gamma using the Maximum Likelihood test.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

   This project is under active development.
